# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution. The project welcomes bug reports, improvements, and small, well-scoped pull requests.

How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing the problem or feature, include steps to reproduce when applicable.
2. If you plan to implement a fix or feature, open a short discussion or a draft PR so maintainers can provide feedback early.
3. Keep changes focused: one logical change per pull request. Prefer small, well-tested commits.

Code style and checks

- The project uses TypeScript. Follow the existing TypeScript patterns in `src/`.
- Linting and type checks should pass before opening a PR. Run `npm run build` and the linter if configured.

Tests

- Tests are not yet required for small documentation or README fixes. For code changes, include unit tests where practical.

License and CLA

- By contributing you agree that your contribution will be licensed under the project license (see `LICENSE`).
